# Astrocyte_Ab

## Project Description
To compare the changes in gene expressions as a result of Amyloid Beta uptake and clearance between APOE33 and APOE44.

## Data
Bulk RNA sequencing data produced by Azenta. 150 bp paired end reads failed QC threshold and therefore analysis was done using 100 bp paired end reads.

## Analysis Pipeline
1). Fastq link
2). FastQC
3). MultiQC
4). Alignment
5). Alignment QC
6). Indexing
7). Feature Count
8). Deseq2
9). GSEA

## Progress
Running Deseq2

Config files for Deseq2 `deseq2_conf`

Metadata `deseq2_conf/Metadat.csv`
